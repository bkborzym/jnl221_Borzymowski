	<h1>At a Flooded Augusta National, Koepka Builds a Lead and Woods Sinks</h1>

	<h2>Third-round play was suspended midafternoon Saturday. Koepka was alone atop the leaderboard, and Woods was at the bottom. Twenty-two strokes separated them.</h2>

	<p>AUGUSTA, Ga. — The raindrops tumbled toward the turf in sheets, rapping umbrellas on their way down and pooling anywhere they could: in shoes, in plastic beer cups, onto the famously — and, on Saturday, formerly — fiery greens at Augusta National Golf Club.</p>

	<p>That last part was a problem, since ponds are no place to play a Masters Tournament. Even though he was merely on the seventh hole, Brooks Koepka minded only so much. By the time tournament officials suspended third-round play about 3:15 p.m., he was among only 11 players to have picked up a stroke or more on a cold, mostly miserable Masters Saturday.</p>

	<p>“That seventh green was soaked,” said Koepka, whose score for the week improved to 13 under par. “It was very tough. I thought I hit a good bunker shot, and it looked like it just skidded on the water, so I’m glad we stopped.”</p>

	<p>Play is scheduled to resume at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday. Koepka will begin with a four-stroke lead over Jon Rahm, who trailed by two at the start of his third round. Everyone else in the 54-man field is at least seven off the lead and expecting a decidedly soft course.</p>

	<p>“I think it’s going to be gettable,” said Sam Bennett, the amateur from Texas A&M University who is in third place, at six under. “I’m guessing we’re going to still have to play it down since we started playing it down, which might be a little tough,” he added, referring to the requirement that players play the ball as it lies on the fairway, even if it’s dirty. “I’m sure there’s going to be some mud balls out there.”<p>

	<p>Probably so, since Georgia mud in the spring cannot easily be eliminated by deploying Augusta National’s SubAir system to suck water from greens.</p>

	<p>All through this Masters week, players and organizers had mused about the threat of rain and the possibility of the first Monday finish since 1983. Tournament officials signaled that they were still hoping to finish the competition as scheduled on Sunday, with the final round set to begin at 12:30 p.m. off the first and 10th tees.</p>

	<p>It has been a vexing stretch for Augusta National, a club that ordinarily revels in brilliant weather during the Masters. The skies forced two stoppages of play on Friday, so when they cleared enough on Saturday for players to finish the second round and begin the third, it seemed a modest victory.</p>

	<p>The hours of play were enough for Koepka to find a bunker on No. 2 and make birdie there anyway — for a second consecutive day. (He birdied there on Thursday, too, without the sandy detour.) Rahm also birdied the hole on Saturday, though his back-to-back bogeys, on Nos. 4 and 5, ultimately left him headed out for the afternoon at nine under.</p>

	<p>For the third round, tournament organizers used groups of three and a two-tee start to try to bank as much golf as they could. When play was suspended, the men at the top of the leaderboard appeared somewhat content.</p>

	<p>The feeling was much different at the bottom, where Tiger Woods was mired in 54th. He had spent the morning stubbornly striving to produce the best mediocre version of himself, and it had been just enough to make the cut that cast Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Bryson DeChambeau out of the tournament much sooner than they would have preferred.</p>
	
	<p>So there was Woods, who has not missed a Masters cut since he turned professional in 1996, bundled up with his comrades as if the tournament had transformed into a British Open burdened by rain and wind.</p>

	<p>One could be forgiven for wondering whether it was worth it.</p>

	<p>Woods began his third round early Saturday afternoon with a perfect drive off the 10th tee, but his approach shot to the plateau green was short and rolled back into the fairway, leading to a bogey. After three routine pars, Woods, whose swing appeared more stiff as Augusta’s temperatures plunged into the 40s, made an awkward pass at the ball on the 14th tee and hooked it into a line of trees left of the 14th fairway. That led to another bogey.</p>

	<p>After a drive in the fairway and a safe layup second shot on the par-5 15th hole, Woods’s limp seemed to be more pronounced as he descended the steep hill toward the green. His pitch shot to the green landed on the putting surface but had too much spin and rolled backward into the pond. His next attempt at clearing the water remained on the green, but after two putts, Woods had his first double bogey of the tournament.</p>

	<p>As he walked onto the tee for the short par-3 16th hole, Woods’s stride looked shorter and his movements constrained. His swing at the golf ball was awkward, and the shot veered left and well short of its target, plopping into the water hazard alongside the hole. His third shot stopped 40 feet from the hole, and two putts later, Woods had registered back-to-back double bogeys, dropping his score for the tournament to nine over.</p>

	<p>Koepka, pursuing his first major victory since 2019, was 22 strokes ahead. He is 30 holes and an iffy weather forecast away from his first Masters title. Sunday morning, the tournament’s official forecast said, could bring a “lingering drizzle.”</p>

	<p>The meteorologists also added a new feature to the weather update: a Monday forecast, just in case.</p>
