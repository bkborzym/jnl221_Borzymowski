        <h2>My intro</h2>

        <!-- Include: a brief intro to yourself -- where you're from, what you like to do for fun, what you're studying, and who your community or family is. -->
        <!-- Tags to use: <p>, <strong>, <i> -->
        <p>My name is <strong>Brooke Borzymowski</strong>, and I am a sophomore Broadcast and Digital Journalism major at Syracuse University.  I am from <i>Fallston, Maryland</i>, where I live with my mom, dad, sister, and dog.  My sister <strong>Rachel</strong> is a senior at Boston University, where she majors in Biology and minors in Art and Psychology.  We both play field hockey at our respective schools, however I am a goalie and she is a defender.  My dog <strong>Stanley</strong> is a two-year-old sheepadoodle, and I am pretty sure he is my mom's favorite child!</p>

        <p>For fun, I like to go to my family's beach house in <i>Rehoboth Beach, Delaware</i>.  At the beach, I swim, paddleboard, boogieboard, and hang out with my family!  When I am not at the beach, I love going to the movie theater and seeing all the latest blockbusters on the big screen.  Most of all, I love spending time with my family, so anything with them is my activity of choice!</p>
